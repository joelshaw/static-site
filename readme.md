## Configuration

After cloning the git repo, run `npm i` in your terminal window. This will install all necessary dev dependencies.

## Development

Once all of your dependencies are installed, run `gulp` to test the installation, if this is successful, it will create a `dist` directory containing all of the compressed files. A browser window will also launch, this is your new project. As you make changes within the `src` folder, the files will automatically compile and reload the screen.
